I'm a passionate, creative, and curious Software Engineer, currently working for [eSpark Learning](https://www.esparklearning.com/). I earned a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a double minor in Mathematics and Spanish at the [University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/). Prior to eSpark I worked at Craftsy (an NBCUniversal company) and the [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) stock exchange. In my current role at eSpark I specialize primarily in data, cloud infrastructure, and backend Software Engineering but I am always eager to develop skills in other areas.
