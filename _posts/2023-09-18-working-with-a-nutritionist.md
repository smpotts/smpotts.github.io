Earlier this year I purchased the NASM Certified Nutrition Coaching program with the aspirations of being a Certified Nutrition. My intention for this wasn't to try to work with clients, but to have the knowledge to further my own personal goals. I thought, why spend even more money paying someone else when I could pay a fraction of the price and just invest my own time in learning more about something I'm already interested in? I knew this would be a huge time committment, but I spent over 35 hours pouring over the course, and after getting about 55% of the way through, I realized this was not going to be enough for me to fill in the knowledge gaps for myself. I learned the hard way there is truly something to be said about having experience with the credentials, so I hired a nutritionist.

I'm a somewhat simple client in that I don't have any health issues or dietary restrictions, but my mind came fully polluted with all the myths of diet culture, things I've heard from other fitness enthusiasts, and one-size fits all approaches I've read in health books. Over the past few months, Lexi has helped me unpack and relearn new, healthier habits, improve my performance, and generally feel so much better. Here are some of my biggest takeaways from this invaluable time spent working with a nutritionist.

## Counting macros doesn't have to be a bad or scary thing
Counting macros is not a punishment, it doesn't have to be restrictive, and it doesn't have to be insanely complicated. This was something I was hesitant to take on when we first started working together, but as a data person, I understood the importance of collecting data to be able to assess what is happening. And that's really all it is. The point of counting macros is primarily to see the breakdown of proteins, carbs, and fats in your diet (among other things like minerals). It was really surprising to me to learn how different foods contributed to each of these categories, and to what degree. Most importantly, knowing where my macro counts are helps me make sure I have eaten enough of the right things to fuel myself before an activity or aid in recovery.

## Eat less, move more is a lie
The age old myth of "just eat less and move more", is just that, a myth. The truth is this is way more complicated than that, and anyone who has ever been on a diet will tell you it doesn't work. Eating less and working out more can actually have detrimental effects on your metabolism and ultimately it will not help you improve your body composition. Going into this experience with my nutritionist, I knew this wasn't an effective strategy, but I actually learned that I was inadventently doing this. My activity level is very high between all the different activities I like to do (especially playing tennis), and I had always gone by a "just eat when you're hungry" approach. It wasn't until I started counting macros that I realized there was a massive discrepancy between the amount of calories I was burning and the calories I was consuming. In some extreme cases, the difference was around 1,000 calories or more. Lexi helped me understand that our bodies will hold on to additional body fat and be in somewhat of a "starvation" state even if we aren't intentionally going without food or feeling hungry. After making adjustments to have my calorie intake match expenditure as much as possible, I immediately saw improvements in my composition.

## Drink more water and eat more (healthy) carbs
Prior to working with Lexi I would follow the Garmin recommendations for hydration, which is roughly half your body weight in ounces with increases to the total amount due to exercise. Lexi's recommendation is at least 100 oz of water regardless of gender, weight, etc. At first it was really hard to hit this number, especially without including coffee, but overtime it became easier, especially with the use of electrolytes. One of my all time favorite recommendations from Lexi is the [Key Nutritents Lemondade electrolytes](https://www.amazon.com/Electrolyte-Powder-Lemonade-Hydration-Supplement/dp/B07Q33CN85), which I take daily now. It tastes great and it's sugar free. I'm legitimately surprised how much hitting these hydration targets improves the way I feel throughout the day.

One of the things I learned from counting macros was how little carbs I was consuming. I didn't know it at the time, but that was a huge contributor to me feeling tired and low energy during physical activity. Lexi helped me find lots of different healthy carb sources that I can include in my diet like red potatoes, bananas, and oatmeal. I have felt a tremendous boost in energy from incorporating more carbs into my meals.

## The scale doesn't capture the whole story
Weighing yourself on a bathroom scale does not give you a very comprehensive picture of what's happening with your body. For that you really need to get an in-body scan. This tells you more in depth metrics about how much water weight you have, muscle vs fat composition, and much more. I still weigh myself on my bathroom scale as a way to collect another data point, but I don't take it as seriously as I did before. I've actually gained weight since the start of working with my nutritionist, but thanks to the in-body scan I know that's because I have put on muscle mass and water weight.

## It's about balance and how you feel
At the start of working with Lexi I was pretty intense about the process and what I needed to do to get the best results. I felt super guilty any time I would slip and make less than desirable choices. It started to make sense what Lexi had been saying this whole time - this is all about balance. It's all about being able to balance a healthy lifestyle with being able to indulge from time to time. One weekend of poor eating or one vacation will not undo all of your progress as long as you get yourself back on track when it's over. Lexi reminds me the most important part of the process if how you feel. These we such critical things to hear that will make this process sustainable for me in the long run.

Working with a nutritionist was one of the best decisions I've made, and I'm really excited to see the progress we make, and all the things I learn throughout the next year.
