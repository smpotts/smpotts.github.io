Over the last two years, my GitHub has mostly been a collection of repositories where I have demoed or experimented with different technologies that piqued my interest. A lot of the repositories I created during that time had a handful of commits, and then I swiftly abandoned them to move onto something else. It wasn't for lack of ideas that I wasn't creating bigger projects, I just didn't really want to invest my time into one particular thing. I thought that by trying out a lot of different and diverse technologies, I was making myself more well rounded and more educated on a wider range of topics. While part of this is true, I think I also did myself a huge diservice, and I've started shifting away from that mindset, in favor of having long term projects.



## things I want to cover
- developing depth in a topic, not just understanding it at a high level
- getting into more interesting problem spaces
- more likely to be able to use applications of that technology in the future
    - putting it on your resume
- being able to put the projects in a portfolio
- having a sense of accomplishment
