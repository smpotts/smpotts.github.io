Several years ago I read a book called "[Rich Bitch](https://nicolelapin.com/rich-bitch/)" by Nicole Lapin (which I *so* highly recommend), and it reshaped my life in so many ways. Not only was it the financial guidance and structure that I needed right out of college, but one of the chapters also outlined a very pragmatic approach for setting and achieving goals which I firmly adopted. Nicole's approach to goals breaks them into a few broad categories:
1. Fun and Functional Goals : these are goals that might help you excel in your hobbies, things you could do to improve your health, new things you want to try, things you've been putting off that you need to do, or just general fun bucket list type things
2. Career Goals : these are goals that help you advance your career. This could include learning a new skill, working towards/ getting a promotion, getting a certification, leading a project, changing jobs
3. Dating Goals : let's face it, finding the love of your life, getting married and living happily ever after doesn't happen overnight
4. Financial Goals : these are goals related to your personal finances. This could be how much money you want to save this year, how much you want to contribute to your 401k, or rebalancing your portfolio

In addition to planning goals in these four categories, Nicole also writes out the goals in 1 year, 5 year, 7 year, and 10 year time segments.

For years, I have stuck to a ritual of writing out goals for the next year on sheets of paper in this format. I've enjoyed reading the goals I set for myself in previous years and accomplished, just as much as I've enjoyed reading the ones I set many years ago that were adorably ambitious. It tends to be the easiest to write out 1 year goals because that's the most predictable and focused amount of time. Usually what happens for the 1 year goals is I have a giant paragraph of all the things I want to do for each category and by the time I get to the 10 year goals, they can look more like wild, unsubstantiated guesses. As the timeline goes on, the list of goals becomes shorter and less focused.

If you're anything like me in previous years, you might be wondering why it's even worth putting 7 or 10 year goals on there. It's no surprise that the 1 year segment is easier to plan for than the 10 year. The reason it's important is because you don't achieve major things or reach a level of master in something overnight. And in order to achieve something big you (usually) have to plan for it and put a significant amount of time into it.

With that in mind, then you're faced with the problem of how to bridge the gap of where you are now and where you want to be to achieve the goal. This can feel extremely daunting when thinking about a particularly large goal that you intend to accomplish in say, 10 years from now, for example if you want to pay off a student loan in 10 years. This is where Nicole's method of breaking down the timeline into smaller segments comes in handy. With the scenario of paying off a loan, you can work backwards and set achievable goals in smaller increments that will lead to paying off the loan in 10 years. This might seem obvious but I wasn't actually doing this in practice.

I started to notice a few recurring patterns in the goals I set for myself. The first pattern is that the longer term goals often felt more like random bucket list items than goals. For instance I had a 7 year goal to "take an extended international vacation". While I think it's ok to have something like this on there, it didn't have other goals in the shorter time frames to support it. Where would be the best places to go? How much money I need to save each year to do this? How long should I stay? How much time off would I need to accrue? To actually pull this off, it needs to be more concrete and it needs to have smaller, reachable milestones.

The second pattern I noticed is that a number of my 1 year goals weren't actually setting me up for growth. Several of them were ambiguous like "stay on top of car maintenance" or "eat less meat". Not having a tangible way to measure these makes them really hard to feel any sense of accomplishment for them at the end of the year. Other 1 year goals felt more like checklist items for things I had either been dragging my feet to complete. I think a few of these are appropriate but too many leads to a to-do list and not a list of goals.

If you ask me, a good goal is something where you have to change or grow in some way to get it. It could be all sorts of things; learning a new skill, removing a mental roadblock to do something, making a lifestyle change, spending lots of time practicing something, saving money for something, etc. Goals should be measurable so that at the end of that period of time, you can look back on it and say whether or not you accomplished it with certainty. Furthermore, short term goals should inspire and reinforce long term goals. There should be a progression over the time segments where you are setting yourself up more and more over 1, 3, and 5 year periods to reach the 7 and 10 year goals.

Using the example from earlier, the supporting goals might look something like this:
1 year: Research destinations and start saving $200 per month
3 year: Decide on a destination and best time of year to go
5/6 year: Began booking flights and hotel for the trip, request that time off
7 year: Go on the extended international trip

Personally, I find it helpful to reevaluate goals every so often and see whether the goals are still achievable or if they are still important to you. If they're not, that's totally ok, adjust them or strike them off the list. Setting goals is an everchanging process.

I am by no means an expert on setting goals and I still struggle to get the process dialed in but thinking about them in this more focused way has helped me tremendously and hopefully this is helpful to someone else.
