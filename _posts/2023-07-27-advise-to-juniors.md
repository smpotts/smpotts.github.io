Tonight I logged onto LinkedIn, which I seldom do, and I had a message from a woman who is currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp ask me what advice I would have for aspiring women interested in software engineering. At first glance I thought that would be an answer question to answer, but I was surprised how challenging it was to come up with solid advice. Quite honestly, I'm not even sure my answer *was* solid advice, but eventually I collected my thoughts into three cohesive points.

The first piece of advice was about using peer feedback and other's suggestions as an opportunity for growth. It can be different starting out in software engineering because we are constantly code reviewing each other's work. This process can feel so demoralizing as a junior team member when you've worked so hard to get something working, and your coworkers bury it with comments and suggestions and ultimately mark it as 'Needs Work'. It's so important to grow out of that and let go of your ego. Code review and peer feedback in general is such a great opportunity to see areas where you're excelling and could improve further. People who are uncooperative and resistant to feedback are difficult coworkers, and they tend to have limited opportunities.

The second thing I mentioned is applying to a job posting even if you don't meet all the criteria they say they're looking for. This is especially important for women because studies have shown that women are way less likely than men to apply to postings where they don't need most of the job description criteria. Potential employers should expect to have to put some time and effort into training their employees to be able to fill in their knowledge gaps. If they don't, it's probably not somewhere you would want to work. I think the tech industry should be extra flexible about programming language requirements because, while they do have their differences, a lot of the languages are similar and could be learned easily.

The most important piece of advice that I wanted to share that someone gave me when I started working in tech, was to find something you like within your industry and try to be the best at it. It's great to be able to dabble in a lot of different things (I do it!), but you want to carve out a space for yourself and develop depth. This creates expertise, job security, leadership opportunities, and allows you more time working on things you love. It's truly a win-win for everyone.

Reading these pieces of advice again, I can say more confidently they make sense, and they're genuine pieces of advice based on the experiences I've had. It's hard not to feel like I missed so many other things, I can think of them endlessly. Work-life balance, setting boundaries, asking for help, etc. This has certainly been a great exercise in self-reflection, and I have a much greater appreciation for all the people I've asked these questions to in the past.
