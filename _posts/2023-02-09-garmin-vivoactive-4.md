After Thanksgiving I was perusing the online Black Friday sales, and decided I was finally going to pull the trigger on buying a smartwatch. I resisted the smartwatch trend for years up until this point. I didn't want another device flashing, beeping, and buzzing to grab my attention. I've kept my phone notifications turned off since the pandemic started, and I was concerned this would be unavoidable with a smartwatch. I'm still rocking the iPhone 6s so living without the luxuries of the latest tech products is very familiar to me. I kept telling myself is that my old Timex stopwatch from 2000-something was perfectly fine to run with. I usually know the distance of the routes I'm running ahead of time anyway so I figured nothing else matters but the time. If anything, I thought that being a data-lover and having data about myself would just make me obsessive with the smartwatch. These things couldn't be further from the truth. My Garmin Vivoactive 4 smartwatch is improving my health and fitness, and it's proven to be a tremendous asset.

Two of the features I didn't think I would care about, that I have actually become the most obsessed with are the Sleep and Hydration statistics. Hydration has to be logged manually, which is a little annoying and time consuming, but if you make a habit of it, it's not so bad. Keeping track of hydration has made me realize I wasn't nearly as hydrated before as I thought. The app tells you how much watch you should drink based on your weight, and then it adds to the baseline based on your activity level for the day. I'm looking forward to seeing my esthetician because she won't be able to yell at me anymore for being dehydrated. The sleep feature isn't the most accurate (in my opinion) in terms of how it breaks down REM sleep/ deep/ light sleep, but the duration of sleep is a good approximation and the way it determines the quality of sleep has felt pretty accurate to me. The watch tracks body stress, how, I don't know, but I've noticed that high body stress correlates to poor sleep. I've seen this if I have a couple drinks late at night, I can see that the first few hours I'm asleep my body is stressed trying to deal with the alcohol and I don't feel well rested at all the next day. I've been way more conscientious of this ever since.

Another thing I really like about the Garmin watches is how customizable they are. I didn't want to connect the watch to my phone notifications so I was able to completely remove those features. I didn't want to watch to buzz or light up or be distracting in anyway, so I configured it to be locked and show the clock face by default, even during workouts (so I'm not looking down at it constantly). That pretty much takes care of my concerns about the watch being annoying and distracting. I'm certaintly not using it to it's full potential, but I love using it daily to log workouts, hydration, weight, sleep, and even see how many steps I had. The last, but not least, thing I love about the Garmin Vivoactive 4 is how classy it looks. I wear it all the time now and it looks great with everything!

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my smartwatch and the impacts it's had on my life so far.
