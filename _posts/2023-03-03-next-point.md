My primary goal for tennis this last year has been to let go of whatever just happened, or happened earlier in the match, and focus on the next point. This is something I really struggled with in the past. I would start getting really upset with myself when I would make mindless mistakes. That frustration would only escalate as the match went on, and I would continue to make more and more unforced errors, and be completely out of focus for the rest of the match. It was almost guaranteed that I would lose the match once I started to spiral deeper and deeper into this head space. One of my coaches explained to me how he had dealt with this same issue, and how he overcame it by shifting his attention to what he was going to do next. At first, I didn't really internalize this because it seemed like a pretty obvious answer. Something is bothering you, just let if go. Of course. The reality is this actually takes a *ton* of focus and practice. Over time, it actually started to work, and I began to see how transformative this mindset shift is.

I think there will always be an element of frustration when you fail to do something you know you're capable of. In fact, I think that's a good thing to be a little upset about it. I try to acknowledge that making an error sucked, and I try to give myself a little time to be disappointed, but the self-loathing and frustrating needs to end there. I have to redirect myself to what I'm going to do next to correct the mistake I just made. Maybe I'm not bending my knees enough, maybe I need to reposition myself in some way. Then I try to channel my energy into doing that. It's not an infallible plan. I still get in funks, but I have noticed they are significantly shorter than they were before. Since I started working on this, I have come back from losing positions to win matches a number of times. This *never* happened to me before. The crazy thing is I've been working on so much I'm seeing its impacts in other aspects of my life. 

Earlier this week I realized that something I worked really hard on that I was very proud of, was riddled with issues. To make it worse it was something I had pushed out in a big announcement to users, so I knew it had people's attention. My first reaction was disappointment and self-loathing. I could feel myself starting to spiral into an unproductive cycle. I quickly started writing down- what are all the problems and where are they? I began to make a list of what my plan was going to be to fix it. First, fix all the fast and easy problems, then create tickets and work my way through the more complex ones. Can any of them wait until next sprint? Let's clear those off the list for now. Surprisingly (but not unsurprisingly), this was extremely successful, and I cleared up most of these issues systematically within the same day. It wasn't until afterwards that I drew the conclusion that I did the exact thing I've been working on for tennis. 

I'm seeing firsthand, shame is a terrible motivator, and I'm getting so much more out of trying to strengthen the mental muscles of redirecting my focus on what to do next.
