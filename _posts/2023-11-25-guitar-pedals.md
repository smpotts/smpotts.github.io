Since I started playing guitar, I have pretty exclusively played the acoustic guitar, which is a shame because I have a really nice Fender Stratocaster American Professional that does not get played nearly as much as it should. A big part of that is because setting up the electric guitar feels inconvenient and another part of that is just habit. I purchased the electric guitar during the pandemic, and I thought the tone and effects knobs on the amplifier were sufficient to get the sounds I wanted. At one point I purchased a used Ibanez tube screamer mini, but I didn't realize it needed a power source after it died. Instead of getting a power brick, I thought the tube screamer was unessential and sold it back to the music store.

Fast forward a couple years, I'm at a concert watching Kyle Cook from Matchbox Twenty play a beautiful metallic blue Telecaster with Rob Thomas on stage. Kyle Cook is a phenominal musician, so much so, it was all I could pay attention to, I decide it's time to spend more time with the electric guitar. When I told this to one of my good friends, he recommended I borrow some pedals. I wasn't super excited about this because I did borrow his JHS Univibe pedal at one point, but quickly lost interest in it. This time he set me up with an actual power brick, an overdrive pedal, and a delay pedal. I was blown away how much better the guitar sounded.

I toggled the pedals on an off, recreating the effects on the amp as I had been doing and the difference was astounding. The pedals sounded so, significantly better. There was no comparison. I can't believe it took me this long to get on board with pedals, but I think I had to listen to the comparison with and without them to truly appreciate them. Prior to using these, I just viewed them as an accessory, and while it's true you can play without them, they make a huge difference. The delay pedal makes the sound thick and full, and the use of the delay pedal behind the overdrive makes the sounds really smooth. I'm enjoying this combination of pedals, and currently doing some online shopping to recreate this setup for myself.

Putting together a good sounding set up is not cheap, but now I understand that pedals are worth the money and make the experience of playing the electric guitar a lot more enjoyable.
