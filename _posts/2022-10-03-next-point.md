My primary goal for tennis this year has been to let go of whatever just happened, or happened earlier in the match, and focus on the next point. This is something I've really struggled with so far. I start getting really upset with myself when I make mindless mistakes. That frustration only escalates as the match goes on, and I continue to make more and more unforced errors, and become completely out of focus for the rest of the match. It is almost guaranteed that I will lose the match once I start to spiral deeper and deeper into this head space. The worst part is, my opponent doesn't have to do anything. All she has to do is get the ball back to me so I can blow the point and beat myself.

I asked one of my coaches for advice and he explained to me how he had dealt with this same issue. He said he overcame it by shifting his attention to what he was going to do next instead of dwelling on what went wrong in the last point. He said to find something you can improve or focus on for the next point and direct your attention to that instead. Since then, I've been trying to put this into practice, but it does indeed take a *ton* of practice. It definitely isn't something that comes naturally at first, especially when my first impulse is to get upset and implode.

I think there will always be an element of frustration when you fail to do something you know you're capable of. In any situation, that's so incredibly frustrating. But the self-loathing aspect is not helpful and only leads to a deeper spiral. The crazy thing is we all know that objectively. The more upset and emotional we get in a situation, the worse it usually gets. It rarely makes things any better, but we still do it because it's a visceral reaction. That's where this element of practice comes in. Like most things, this is a skill to develop, and I'll improve at it the more I'm presented with these types of situations. With playing more tennis, there's no doubt I will...
