Here’s a collection of personal projects I’ve worked on — some started out of curiosity, others from a desire to build something useful. All of them helped me learn along the way.

## **Hinge Data Analysis**
*A Python project that analyzes and visualizes personal data exports provided by the dating app Hinge.*  

By examining the user's profile, dating preferences, and interactions with other users, the project aims to reveal patterns, trends, and meaningful statistics that enhance the understanding of how users engage with Hinge and make decisions based on their preferences.

- Technologies: Python, Plotly, Pandas, Docker  
- Data Source: Personal data exports from Hinge  
- GitHub: [View Repository](https://github.com/smpotts/hinge-data-analysis)  
- Key Features: Analyzes user profile presentation, dating preferences, messaging patterns, response times, and match durations

## **Palmer Penguins Data Storytelling**
*A data science portfolio project using the palmerpenguins dataset*   

In this notebook, I leverage data analysis and visualization techniques using ggplot2, and I explore and uncover insights from the palmerpenguins dataset through compelling visualizations.

- Technologies: R, Jupyter, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr  
- Focus: Reproducible visual insights from real-world ecological data  
- GitHub: [View Repository](https://github.com/smpotts/palmerpenguins-data-story)

## **BRFSS 2021 Mental Health Analysis**  
*Predicting mental health outcomes using CDC survey data*  

This project analyzes data from the 2021 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a large-scale health survey conducted by the CDC. Using linear regression models, the notebook explores how factors like employment status, e-cigarette usage, and receiving the flu shot relate to reported mental health outcomes.

- Technologies: R, Jupyter, tidyverse, lm.beta
- Dataset: 2021 BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)  
- Focus: Mental health prediction using linear regression  
- GitHub: [View Repository](https://github.com/smpotts/brfss-health-modeling)
